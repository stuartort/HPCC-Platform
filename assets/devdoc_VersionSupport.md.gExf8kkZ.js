The extra symbols allow the system to generate stack backtraces which make it much easier to diagnose problems if they occur. The &quot;release without symbols&quot; version is recommended for Kubernetes production deployments. Deploying a system without symbols reduces the size of the images. This reduces the time it takes Kubernetes to copy the image before provisioning a new node.</p>',36)]))}const m=a(o,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
